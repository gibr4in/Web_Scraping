# Web scraping

Web scraping is a technique used to **extract data from websites**. It involves programmatically accessing a website's content and pulling out information, typically for the purpose of data analysis, research, or other applications. Web scraping can be done manually, but it is more commonly automated using specialized software tools or programming languages.

There are multiple web scraping libraries available for python like Selenium, Scrapy, or Beautiful Soup
